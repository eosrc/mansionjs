Description: (for github)
Environment to build places, digital spaces or digital estates.

Motivations
-----------

- pioneering spirit
	
	Many who live in the Americas have ancestors, who at one time,
decided to emigrate to the "new world". For the earliest ones,
one of the first thing they had to do when they arrived was to
build a house. 

	Twenty years ago, the web was invented. People built homepage,
but commerce seemed more promising, and we had the "internet bubble".
As is often the case with commerce, people looks for things 
fashionable: "the new new thing". 

	Not many people have looked to the web as a "new world" where
we can emigrate and live. Even social networks, like Facebook,
don't treat the web as a place, they are creating communities
of people with common interest. We don't create cozy environment
where few people can hang out and spend time together. 

	A real house is made of bricks and mortar, a mansion or digital
estate is made of bits and bytes, and since we are using a
scripting language, mainly strings. For many people the acquisition
of a house will the biggest purchase of their life. In a similar
way, building a mansion will require a significant investment in
time. Beyond providing shelter, a house has a lasting value. If you
have the means, and you make a significant investment in the architecture,
decoration and maintenance of the house, the place will outlive its
original owner. Like Versailles, or the great medieval cathedrals, it
has beauty. 

	Mansion.js aims to be that environment where the digital equivalent
of Versailles, or the great medieval cathedrals, can rise. The website
[CSS Zen Garden][1] was a nice experiment in showing off beautiful
designs created with digital tools. But the website was used to present
the final "product", it was not an environment where the craftsmen worked
together to produce the final result.

- RB organized community life for 15 centuries
	- copying manuscripts; programming rooms and mansions

		The Rule of Benedict was written in the sixth century, and
it has directed the lives of monks in the West ever-since. At 
one time, monasteries got a significant part of their income coming
from the work of monks copying manuscripts. If the person placing
the order for the manuscript gave a large sum, the book produced
was a work of art. The people, who will spend all or most of their
time with Mansion.js, will need some income. I hope that, instead
of copying manuscripts, we'll be able to generate these incomes by
programming rooms and mansions.

		Copying manuscripts by hand has disappeared since the invention
of the printing press. All Mansion.js code is in Html/Css/Javascript,
will these still be around in a hundred years? five hundred years?
We don't know. But I suspect that we'll still be able to display
text file on paper-like support. Because of this, I like the markdown
format. I started to sketch a format for objects in Mansion.js using
markdown but I didn't have time to complete it. I brought this up
because more time should be spent on defining how to represent the
raw data that will make up the objects, and rooms in Mansion.js.

- places as living history

	An important command that can be issued in the input box is
record (/r), this will save all the messages that appear into
local storage. I would like users to assume that all their actions
is recordered (Mansion.js version of "big brother"). One reason is
to emphasize that this is not a game but a place. But more importantly,
in a digital environment, we can view a place as a living history.

	When I was a student, I thought I would have like to be a little
bird flying around Einstein and Godel, on their daily walk to their
office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, listening to
their conversation. In Mansion.js, this is possible by using the
recorder. 

- like playing with Lego blocks 

	Many kids, including me, spent a lot of time playing Lego
blocks. Build a thing, tear it apart and building again a little
differently. I hope that Mansion.js will encourage this practice.
Beauty and a seed of eternity rarely show up on a first try.

- time for confessions

	First, I just started to take Javascript seriously a few
months ago. And I needed convincing. I browsed Crockford's
"Javascript: The Good Parts", but I needed more. I found it
in Resig's Ninja book. The functional view of Javascript
appealed to me. Depending on your knowledge of programming
languages and theory, it might or might not mean much. But
to me, it brought back good memories of Scheme and ML, from
my work on formal verification in the early 90's.

	Second, as stated at the beginning of the README file,
this is a mini version of Mansion.js. I just tried to put
together a working prototype of my initial intuition as
quickly as possible. It is buggy, slow and incomplete but
its vision of lasting beauty is still appealing.
